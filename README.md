During the javascript learning phase, I developed a random quote generator and generated normal features.
These projects have helped me understand the "fetch()" method in Javascript, as well as develop expertise. In general, when we retrieve data from an API, we receive it in JSON format, which we can use as needed.
I'm using this API to generate quotes at random for this project.
An API is a kind of external source that permits access to another resource with authorization. APIs play a crucial role in backend programming, enabling the development of fully functional online applications.
